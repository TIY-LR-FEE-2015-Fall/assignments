# Assignment Instructions

These are the basic requirements for turning in assignements for this course.
Assignments may modify or add new requirements, but the following should be understood as the place to start.

* [Create a new issue in this repository for each assignment](https://github.com/TIY-LR-FEE-2015-June/assignments/issues/new)
  + Name your issue with these three parts: the assignment number, the assignment name, and your full name, e.g. `01 - Personal Website - Ryan Tablada`
  + If todos (i.e. check boxes) are provided for you in the assignment file, include them in a `Requirements` section of your Issue
  + If todos are _not_ provided for you (as in later assignments), create your own; you will be expected to break down many assignments on your own
  + Estimate the complexity, difficulty, and risk of each major piece of the assignment with point values from 1-8 where 1 is a something of minor difficulty and 8 would take you a full afternoon.
* Create a new repository for the assignment
  + Name the repository according to the assignment, e.g.
    `01-personal-website` (note that you should match this to the folder name here)
  + Create a branch in that repository named `<initials>-develop`
  + Ensure that you commit _all_ your work into that branch _only_
  + Push that branch to Github regularly to show progress
* Check off todos as you finish to demonstrate progress
  + As you check off todos you will see that the progress bar will update as you check off todos.
* Open a Pull Request (PR) from your `<initials>-develop` branch to `master`
  + [Add a link to your
    Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#references)
    in a comment on your Pull Request
  + Note that the PR will update automatically as you push more work to the
    branch
  + Do this step _as soon as you have a commit_; don't wait until the due
    date!
* Update the Label on your issue to `Ready For Review`
  + This will allow me to know when your assignment is ready to be looked at
